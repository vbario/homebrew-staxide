  # First-launch note: the .app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID
  # yet), so macOS Gatekeeper will block the first open. Tell the user
  # to right-click → Open the first time, or strip the quarantine xattr.
  # Once we notarize, this caveat goes away.
  caveats <<~EOS
    The build is not yet notarized. On first launch macOS may say the
    developer cannot be verified — right-click STAX IDE in
    /Applications and choose Open, then click Open in the dialog.
    A subsequent double-click works normally.

    Or, from the terminal:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/STAX IDE.app"
